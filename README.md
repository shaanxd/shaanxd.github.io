# My Developer Journey :)

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio! This project serves as a central hub to present my creativity and skills as a developer and instead of your average Kanban board I thought of building something fun! :)

## Built Using

- [Kaplay](https://kaplayjs.com/) – Underlying game engine based on JavaScript, TypeScript
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – You know why ;)
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) - For creating maps out of tilesheets.

## Credits

Development itself was the easier part. Big thanks to the incredible set of people who have crafted the stuff necessary to make this happen.
